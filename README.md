# ANNDL-Leaf-Classification

The repository shows the models implemented for the Image Classification challenge of the course "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" held at Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2021-2022).

The challenge consisted on the classification of different leaf categories. Two final models are developed by me and other 2 collegues: [one](vgg16balanced.ipynb) uses the transfer learning approach with VGG16 as base model while the [second one](Handcrafted architecture model/HandCraftedArchitecture.ipynb) exploits an handcrafted architecture combined with image augmentation.

Check out the final [report](Paper%ANNDL.pdf).
